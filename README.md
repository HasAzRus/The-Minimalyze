# The-Minimalyze
  My old project, which I have had for a year without updating. So, if someone is interested in the project, you can continue it.

  The project began to be developed back in 2018, when I was still studying programming and did not have such experience. So this project was purely my experiment. The project has a lot of jambs, bugs, and errors.
Now I'm more than experienced, but I don't want to do this project.

  And what about the project, what is it? This is a pixel game in the genre of shooting games. According to the idea, the game did not include a story part. Well, if you have an idea to add a story, then please. The game is based on the Game Maker Studio 1.4 engine.
  
  Minimalyze Hardcore Edition is a pixel arcade game with horror elements.
Earth has been invaded by a disease that turns people into merciless monsters. The main character will have to fight against them. And perhaps the future of this small pixel world depends on you.
  The goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible. At first glance, it seems that the game is not so difficult, but believe me, over time, you will learn the complexity of the game.
Destroy as many enemies as possible, and for this you are given several types of weapons.
  1. Gun
  2. The gun
  3. MAK 10 
  4. MP 5 
  5. AK 47
  6. Machine gun
  7. Flamethrower
  8. Chainsaw
